This App is a dedicated platform to connect two different people, which both are renting an apartment and both are searching for a new 
apartment to rent. Both people are living in an apartment that is considered to be under the current fee in the market and thus want to use this
leverage and exchange their apartment for a better/equal apartment value and not to put their apartment available for the open market.
The user will choose his desired apartment details and the app will show him a variety of apartments that match his search.
The user can decide if it suits him or not by clicking on the “Like” button (Heart) and the “Dislike” button(X). 
If both sides (2 different users) liked each other, they will get to see the other user’s phone number.
